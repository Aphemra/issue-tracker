# Issue Tracker Frontend

The frontend portion of this fullstack issue tracker portfolio piece made with React.js.

## Planned Layout Features

-   Kanban Board is drag-and-drop for issue elements
-   Issues will open up for edit in a floating modal center aligned
-   New project button will open either a new page or floating modal (tbd)
-   Ability to change color of custom tags
-   Kanban Board view will be sortable by status or other sortable fields (date for example)
-   Would also like to add the ability for issues to reference the completion state of other issues, self-completing when these issues are completed (lite sub issues feature)
-   Check box groups within issues will show a progress bar when in kanban view mode and can optionally also show the checks so they are more convenient to check (without having to open the whole issue for edit)
-   Will look into automation or custom actions for ease of extensibility
